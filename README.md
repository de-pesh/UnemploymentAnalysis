### Project Overview

This project involves analyzing employment-related data in India to identify patterns and trends. The analysis is done through:

•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
•	Visualization of key metrics
•	Heatmaps for correlation between variables

The analysis helps in understanding the unemployment rate, the number of employed people, and the labor participation rate.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following key variables:

•	Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): Percentage of unemployed individuals.
•	Estimated Employed: Number of employed individuals.
•	Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): Percentage of people participating in the labor force.

## Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis.git
    cd unemployment-analysis
```
2.	Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.	Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the .ipynb file.

## Project Structure

•	unemployment.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
•	data/: Directory where the dataset is stored.
•	requirements.txt: Contains the list of Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## Visualization

The project uses the following visualization techniques:

•	Line Plots: To show the unemployment trend over time.
•	Bar Charts: To compare employment metrics between different regions.
•	Heatmaps: To visualize the correlation between the unemployment rate, employed individuals, and labor participation rate.

## Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix is generated to understand the relationship between the key variables in the dataset. The heatmap visualization helps in identifying strong or weak correlations, which provides insights into how these employment factors influence each other.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to understand key employment trends in India, offering insights into how various factors related to unemployment and labor participation are correlated. The visualizations provide a clearer picture of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.
